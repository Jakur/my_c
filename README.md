# my_c
A small toy language for exploring compilers

+Requirements:
1) Linux Operating System
2) Bison
3) Flex
4) g++ supporting the C++17 Standard

+Instructions:
1) Ensure Flex and Bison are installed and in the path.
2) Run the makefile in the src directory with the command "make" to compile the interpreter.
3) To evaluate programs, pipe output from a file into my-c, e.g. cat ../examples/prog5 | ./my-c

+Example Programs:
1) Proj4Ex1 is a blanket test of the my_c language.
2) Proj4Ex2 finds the range of an array, i.e. the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value.
3) Proj4Ex3 calculates the factorial of 5 and the value of 5^5.
4) Proj4Ex4 Calculate the sum of 1 to 50 using a loop and calculates the sum using a formula and compares the two values.
5) Proj4Ex5 prints the largest number and the average between 332, 367, 313.
